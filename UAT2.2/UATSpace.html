<!-- html comment out the Back story:

  The Texas landscape isn't for the faint of heart, 1903 May 13th. Each month you must   make this run for supplies,the homestead needs it. The spouse will have your head if you muck things up this time. The last trip cost us a horse.

   You stroll into this dusty old town, memories of your last venture here vaugely come to mind. After walking three miles you're looking to quench your thirst and find something to do to ease your mind. Theme from "The good, the bad and the ugly" plays in your head as the casino comes to sight. 
 
  'Hmm, a drink, a game and a room', You mumble to yourself as you head toward the door. The "Casino Saloon" is lively this evening. The aroma of fine whiskey and stale tobacco fill the saloon almost as thick as the chatter. Sam sat in the corner tickling the ivory tipping his bola hat in acknowlegement to your arrival. While the drunkards and others stumble about trying to do, what you can only guess is, dance. 
  
  'Open Spot For Craps Over Here!!' a Croupier calls out from the corner. "Why not?" you thought as you grab a drink and head to the craps table in the corner to test your luck.

  Just don't lose your lot this time. The last words you hear before you pull your money out is your spouse saying, "You already lost a horse! What next the farm?" Shaking the thought away you hear yourself say "Roll EM!!"
